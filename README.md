# linuxinstall
These are some basic scripts to setup my debian based distros environment alongside the [dotfiles](https://github.com/Fritzzin/dotfiles) repo. 

## install.sh
Updates the repository and install the basic packages that I need.

## update.sh
Updates the system via apt.

## clean.sh
Uses maintenance commands to keep apt clean such as autoremove and autoclean.

## monoaudio.sh
One of my laptop speakers died, so this is a solution I've found for mono audio.
